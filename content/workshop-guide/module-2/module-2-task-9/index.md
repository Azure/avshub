  Task 9: Create network profiles

## **HCX Network Profiles**

A Network Profile is an abstraction of a Distributed Port Group, Standard Port Group, or NSX Logical Switch, and the Layer 3 properties of that network. A Network Profile is a sub-component of a complete Compute Profile.

> Customerâ€™s environments may vary and may not have separate networks.

In this Task you will create a Network Profile for each network intended to be used with HCX services. More information can be found in VMware's Official Documentation, [Creating a Network Profile.](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.3/hcx-user-guide/GUID-184FCA54-D0CB-4931-B0E8-A81CD6120C52.html)

- **Management Network** - The HCX Interconnect Appliance uses this network to communicate with management systems like the HCX Manager, vCenter Server, ESXi Management, NSX Manager, DNS, NTP.
- **vMotion Network** - The HCX Interconnect Appliance uses this network for the traffic exclusive to vMotion protocol operations.
- **vSphere Replication Network** - The HCX Interconnect Appliance uses this network for the traffic exclusive to vSphere Replication.
- **Uplink Network** - The HCX Interconnect appliance uses this network for WAN communications, like TX/RX of transport packets.

These networks have been defined for you, please see below section.

In a real customer environment, these will have been planned and identified previously, see here for the [planning
phase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/plan-private-cloud-deployment#define-vmware-hcx-network-segments).

### **Exercise 1: Create Network Profiles**

#### Step 1: Create 4 Network Profiles

![](Mod2Task9Pic1.png)

1. Click **Interconnect**.
2. Click **Network Profiles**.
3. Click **CREATE NETWORK PROFILE**.
Create a network profile, use IP addresses allocated during the planning phase. In this lab, these are in the [Getting Started](#_On-Premises_HCX_details_1) section. We will create 4 separate network profiles:
    -  Management
    -  vMotion
    -  Replication
    -  Uplink

#### Step 2: Enter information for each Network Profile

![](Mod2Task9Pic2.png)

1. Select **Distributed Port Groups**.
2. Select **Management Network**.
3. Enter the **Management Network IP** range from the table below. Remeber to replace X with your group number and Y with your participant number. Repeat the same steps for Replication, vMotion and Uplink Network profiles.
4. Ensure the select the appropriate checkboxes depending on type of Network Profile you're creating.

> You should create a total of 4 Network Profiles.
