Log in to the Recovery vCenter Server's and confirm the VM you created earlier and protected has been successfully powered on at the Recovery Site. 

Since this was a recovery plan **test**:
-   The VM in the protected site has NOT been shut down.
-   The VM in the recovery site has been attached to an isolated network segment, as per the configuration you created in a previous task.

#### Step 5: Cleanup

This process cleans up (powers off) the VM and returns everything to the previous state for protection.
